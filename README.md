This is a under construction page I designed and developed while my website was under construction. It is now up here for anyone else who is looking for a creative and simple under construction page to put up or to be inspired from.

## How to use it?

Download the zip file or fork it and make changes to the HTML to personalize the links and picture. I have also included comments to remind you what you need to change!
